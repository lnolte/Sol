# Sol
A declarative functional language for creative coding. Initially created to
learn more about parsers and interpreters.

```
(draw <1000 1000> [
  (rect <200 200> <800 800> { :fill "black" })
])
```

## Why Sol?
Named after conceptual artist [Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt).

## Is this a stupid idea?
Mostly yes, but also interesting.

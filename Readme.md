# Toy
When you just want to learn a bit about how computers work and end up writing a
stupid small interpreter for some lispy programming language you made up on the fly.

Yes, it's fully implemented in JavaScript. Yes this is a stupid idea. But hey,
it's for learning purposes only.

```
(def hello (add 4 2))

(println
  (sub hello (add 3 10))
)
```

## Is it stupid?
Yes

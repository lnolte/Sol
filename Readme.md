# Sol
A declarative functional language for creative coding. Initially created to
learn more about parsers and interpreters.

```
(def hello (add 4 2))

(println
  (sub hello (add 3 10))
)
```

## Why Sol?
Named after conceptual artist [Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt).

## Is this a stupid idea?
Mostly yes, but also interesting.
